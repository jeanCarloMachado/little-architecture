# Little architecture Hands on

First is good to get the end result. And then I can improve my ways to get there.
This is a hands on talk about the little architecture.

Simplify the problem, first start assuming a endless amount of notes.

I don't want to go too deep in the unit testing. If we stay at the simplest requirement level we can refactor the code. Don't test code.


First problem solved:

1. Get the right notes given the existence of them in the database
2. account for notes limit
The code might not even be beautiful, the refactoring step of TDD is optional.
The important part is convey the user requirements in the unit-test.
