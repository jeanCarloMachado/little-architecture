# Little architecture Hands on


This is a hands on talk about the little architecture.

Simplify the problem, first start assuming a endless amount of notes.

I don't want to go too deep in the unit testing. If we stay at the simplest requirement level we can refactor the code. Don't test code.


First problem solved:

- Get the right notes given the existence of them in the database
