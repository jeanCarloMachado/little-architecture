## Summary

In this talk I'll walk you through how to create a system in which the
code speaks for itself, not imposing upfront design and still being
prepared for changes when they come. A way of coding systems that
maximizes for quality and delivery speed.

## Full description

I'll create a ATM use case for an hypothetical bank with you and walk
you through from the minimal requirements until having a set of classes
that are ready to be shipped. We are going to use TDD, to build a system
that uses Object-Oriented design, Functional Programming, and aspect
oriented programming when they are most suited for the problem at hand.
